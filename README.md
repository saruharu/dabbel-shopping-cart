## Steps to run the application

1. Download or clone the current repository.
2. Open the project in your local machine/editor.
3. In your terminal set on the project's path, run the command `npm install` to install dependencies from package.json file.
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200/` to display the application.

## Testing the different layouts
In order to test the different responsive layouts, use your browser's responsive/phone/tablet simulator.

## Additional Features
In addition to the main features defined in the assessment's file, this application offers a few extra functionalities:
1. Title: One can define the title of each page to be displayed in the browser's tab.
2. A strings file: instead of putting the strings hardcoded into the HTML templates, I chose to store them in a strings file called "english.ts". This is will make it easier to include translation/internationalization into the application.
